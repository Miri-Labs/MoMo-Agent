# MoMo Agent for Mac — development foundation

This is the runtime foundation for the MoMo Agent Mac application.
It starts the Hermes code inside this repository. It does not launch an installed
Hermes Desktop app and does not use the user's existing Hermes configuration.
The product UI, signed app packaging and background-service installer are not
implemented in this checkpoint.

## Prepare and run

From the repository root, with `uv` and Python 3.14 available:

```sh
MOMO_DEV_DATA="$PWD/tmp_agent_output/momo-agent"
uv run --no-project --python 3.14 Apps/MacApp/Runtime/momo_agent.py init --data-dir "$MOMO_DEV_DATA"
uv run --no-project --python 3.14 Apps/MacApp/Runtime/momo_agent.py prepare --data-dir "$MOMO_DEV_DATA"
```

`init` creates a private data directory and a stable workspace, assistant and
instance identity. Repeating it does not rotate credentials or overwrite user
configuration. A nonempty directory without a valid MoMo identity is refused.
The default location, when `--data-dir` is omitted, is
`~/Library/Application Support/MoMoAgent/Agent`.

Configure `hermes/config.yaml` in that data directory with an explicit model,
provider and (for a custom OpenAI-compatible provider) base URL. Store that
provider's credentials in the same directory's `hermes/.env`; the launcher does
not inherit model keys or Hermes settings from the launching shell.

```sh
uv run --no-project --python 3.14 Apps/MacApp/Runtime/momo_agent.py serve --data-dir "$MOMO_DEV_DATA"
```

This runs in the foreground and listens only on `127.0.0.1:8765`; choose a different
port at `init` if required. The API requires the private credential in `api-key`.
`connection.json` contains identities and the address, never the credential.
Use `status --data-dir "$MOMO_DEV_DATA"` in another terminal to read capabilities.
Terminate the foreground service explicitly; client exit does not terminate it.

`prepare` uses upstream PM's `build_environment` and the committed `uv.lock`,
selecting `mcp` and `messaging` (the pinned source's API adapter needs the latter's
aiohttp). It builds Python dependencies without installing another Hermes source
package; MoMo imports `Vendor/HermesAgent` explicitly. The preparation record binds
dependencies to this checkout, lock, manifest and selected extras. A changed
dependency identity requires preparing a new development runtime. No global
Hermes environment or shell configuration is modified.

Optional managed binaries such as ffmpeg, Node and ripgrep are not packaged by this
checkpoint. Upstream can report those as not prepared. The verified path covers
the API and MCP; each additional tool needs its own dependency and capability
checks before product delivery. No automatic source update is exposed by this
launcher. Updates to the embedded source belong to the MoMo release process.

## Swift client

`Packages/MoMoAgentAgentClient` is a Foundation-only package for iOS/macOS, with
no Pi dependency. It exposes capabilities, submit, snapshot and explicit stop.
Callers must persist the operation and session IDs before submission. It never
automatically retries an ambiguous submission, nor sends stop when a local task
or view is cancelled. The `unknown` status is not successful completion.

The included developer probe reads the private connection files locally:

```sh
swift build --package-path Packages/MoMoAgentAgentClient
swift run --package-path Packages/MoMoAgentAgentClient momo-agent-probe capabilities "$MOMO_DEV_DATA"
# submit DATA_DIR SESSION_ID OPERATION_UUID INPUT
# status DATA_DIR RUN_ID
# stop DATA_DIR RUN_ID
```

The HTTP client permits HTTPS, or loopback HTTP for local development, and refuses
redirects. Endpoint credentials are supplied out of band; no query-string keys.
SSE, history fallback after run retention expires, approvals, the persistent phone
outbox and the phone composition switch remain later migration work.

## Verification

```sh
uv run --no-project --python 3.14 -m unittest discover -s Tests/AgentRuntime -v
swift test --package-path Packages/MoMoAgentAgentClient
```

For an end-to-end developer check, initialize and prepare a **fresh dedicated**
test runtime, build the Swift probe, then run:

```sh
uv run --no-project --python 3.14 Tests/AgentRuntime/smoke.py --data-dir "$MOMO_DEV_DATA"
```

The smoke script replaces that test runtime's model configuration, starts a local
scripted model and a real MCP tool, launches embedded Hermes and invokes it through
the Swift client. It checks detach, actual tool output, duplicate submission and
restart recovery. All input is synthetic; no phone or real model account is used.
The script shuts its services down and writes `runtime/smoke-results.json` and
`runtime/smoke-gateway.log`. A previous tool receipt causes a refusal so repeat
runs cannot be mistaken for a fresh result. It is not a test of model quality,
independent remote networks or phone migration.

## 手机与记忆主线

手机使用 `connection.json` 与本实例配对密钥连接。任务 API 与资料同步 API 使用同一身份，开发入口只绑定 loopback；手机模拟器可直接使用，真实异地接入需 HTTPS/隧道。完整转录同步到 Mac 的 MoMo context，Hermes 经 MCP 按修订和游标读取。受限的 momo-memory profile 自动整理有精确证据的记忆，不执行录音中的建议。

最新交互、模拟器复现、fork 补丁与限制见 [远程主线记录](../../docs/implementation/hermes-remote-mainline-20261021.md)。手机不运行 Pi，也不在 Mac 断开时本地接管。
